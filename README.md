# Mobile-Application
This is the Source Code for Goats Anon Mobile, an anonymous social media discussion applciation.

This application was completed as the final project for CS-4518: Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing taught by Professor Tian Guo.

To run the code, open up the 'Goat-Anon-Mobile' folder. Within this folder you are gonig to want to cd into 'my-new-project' and then in the terminal type 'npm install' to install all of the dependencies. 

Once the installation is complete, you can run the application by typing the command 'expo start' in the terminal. The broject should then build.

If there is an error, then you may need to install expo by following the directions here : https://expo.io/learn.

When the project has been built correctly, you can open it up in a web-view by pressing w, however, that is not the optimal way to view the application because the formatting will be off. If you install the expo client app on your mobile phone, and then open the app that way, that will give you the best results when viewing the app. The app is formatted specifically for the iPhone 11 Pro, so if you don't have that, then perhaps it is not worth the trouble of getting the app.
